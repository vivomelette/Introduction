Hello, fellow GitHub members! =)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
- I'll come up with a cool nickname later...
- Male, he/him pronouns!
- I'm a beginner who's trying to get into programming. Currently trying to learn Web Development, but I also want to get into something
  like C or Rust (in the future) to work with more complex stuff.
- Has tried various Linux distributions (Debian, Ubuntu, Mint, EndeavourOS (easy-to-install Arch)) on real hardware.
  Unfortunately, I'm an Nvidia user, so I encountered different issues, even on X11 protocol. So I ended up
  coming back to Windows 10. However, now I set up WSL2 with Debian 12 for development.
- "average soy dev vs code fan". Maybe I'll get into Vim (or NeoVim, to be exact) in the future. 
- I'm a complete frickin' newbie who has to learn such things as programming, git and other stuff.
  I hope I can do more in the future!
